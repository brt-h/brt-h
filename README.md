Hello, I'm Robert ðŸ‘‹

I just finished the IBM Data Science Professional Certification and am building a data science portfolio here on github... currently under construction!

### Collected course assignments
A [compilation of notebooks](https://gist.github.com/brt-h) uploaded as gitub gists as I worked my way through 10 courses covering python, data science tools, methodology, databases, SQL, visualization, analysis, and machine learning

### Falcon 9 1st Stage Booster Landing Prediction

Enabled a hypothetical competitor to make more informed bids against SpaceX by using 1st stage landing predictions as a proxy for the cost of a launch.
Utilized PowerPoint, SQL, Python, JupyterLab, Pandas, Numpy, Dash, Plotly, Folium, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. This project served as the capstone for the IBM certification so there are some superfluous slides (14-25) included for peer-grading purposes. Pdf report is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18DX_Mu0pVxPG2ebD1Nnt1i-AZgLj99kl/view). The code can be found [here](https://github.com/brt-h/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone)

### SpaceX Launch Records Dashboard
Enabled hypothetical stakeholders to explore and manipulate Falcon 9 launch data in an interactive and real-time way. Utilized Python, Pandas, Plotly Express, and Dash. [Here](https://ibm-applied-data-science-capst.herokuapp.com/) is my live dashboard deployed to Heroku. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/brt-h/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/spacex_dash_app.py).

### Predicting if Customers will Default on Loans
Tested four different machine learning models to see which would most accurately predict if a customer would default on their loan or if it would be paid off.  Utilized Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Jupyter notebook is [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/bd06edd5-2ae4-4f62-aee2-502b29d86f07/view?access_token=02d69abd44e4d53ab9ea6fd51403421a29de81656dbb92e235c576c6bd5fb35c).

### Analyzing relationship between home characteristics and sale price
Used provided dataset of home sales in King County, USA between May 2014 and May 2015 to practice data analysis. Jupyter notebook is [here](https://gist.github.com/brt-h/a7b5dd74a8fcd2e718a5cde7cf9147ab).

### Extracting and visualizing stock data
Used yfinance and webscraping to extract stock data then visualize it using Plotly. Utilizedd Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly. Jupyter notebook is [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/5937dca4-8cdb-41d5-8ab0-25134f6f4945/view?access_token=9ebd45117d303eb29148c8c7859894ebc6f0457e9bd0a76d5ae077db1f8ad41d).
