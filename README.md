Hello, I'm Robert ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio

I recently finished IBM Data Science Professional Certification (10-month program), and have been building a data science portfolio here on github... currently under construction!

I'm currenty looking for work as a Data Analyst or similar, so if you've got an idea about me, or know of any good work opportunity that would be beneficial to me, please let me know!

### Collected course assignments & coding practice problems
A [compilation of 75+ notebooks](https://gist.github.com/brt-h) uploaded as github gists as I worked my way through 10 courses covering python, data science tools, methodology, databases, SQL, visualization, analysis, and machine learning. Since then I have been adding gists for problems I work through on hackerrank, edabit, leetcode, etc.

### AirBnB Tableau Dashboard

The hypothetical use case for this dashboard is to help someone who is purchasing property in Seattle to rent on AirBnB. The focus of this dashboard is the relationships between AirBnB price and (1) zipcode, (2) # of bedrooms, and (3) week of the year. The dashboard can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robert.hyman/viz/AirBnBTableauProject_16414256273360/Dashboard1).

### Forest Cover Kaggle Prediction

Predicted between 7 different classes of tree cover found in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado, using a training dataset consisting of 4 million labled samples with features like elevation, soil type, etc. This location is interesting because of minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices. Utilized Python and Pandas in jupyter notebook to test SGD, LSVC, XGB, CatB, and LGBM classifiers. Kaggle notebook is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/brthym/tps-dec-sgd-lsvc-xgb-catb-lgbm).

### Falcon 9 1st Stage Booster Landing Prediction

Enabled a hypothetical competitor to make more informed bids against SpaceX by using 1st stage landing predictions as a proxy for the cost of a launch.
Utilized PowerPoint, SQL, Python, JupyterLab, Pandas, Numpy, Dash, Plotly, Folium, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. This project served as the capstone for the IBM certification so there are some superfluous slides (14-25) included for peer-grading purposes. Pdf report is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18DX_Mu0pVxPG2ebD1Nnt1i-AZgLj99kl/view). The code can be found [here](https://github.com/brt-h/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone)

### SpaceX Launch Records Dashboard
Enabled hypothetical stakeholders to explore and manipulate Falcon 9 launch data in an interactive and real-time way. Utilized Python, Pandas, Plotly Express, and Dash. [Here](https://ibm-applied-data-science-capst.herokuapp.com/) is my live dashboard deployed to Heroku. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/brt-h/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/spacex_dash_app.py).

### Predicting if Customers will Default on Loans
Tested four different machine learning models to see which would most accurately predict if a customer would default on their loan or if it would be paid off.  Utilized Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Jupyter notebook is [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/bd06edd5-2ae4-4f62-aee2-502b29d86f07/view?access_token=02d69abd44e4d53ab9ea6fd51403421a29de81656dbb92e235c576c6bd5fb35c).

### Analyzing relationship between home characteristics and sale price
Used provided dataset of home sales in King County, USA between May 2014 and May 2015 to practice data analysis. Jupyter notebook is [here](https://gist.github.com/brt-h/a7b5dd74a8fcd2e718a5cde7cf9147ab).

### Extracting and visualizing stock data
Used yfinance and webscraping to extract stock data then visualize it using Plotly. Utilizedd Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly. Jupyter notebook is [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/5937dca4-8cdb-41d5-8ab0-25134f6f4945/view?access_token=9ebd45117d303eb29148c8c7859894ebc6f0457e9bd0a76d5ae077db1f8ad41d).
